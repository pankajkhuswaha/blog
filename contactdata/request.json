It all started in the year 1995 when Brendan Eich created JavaScript in a span of 10 days. Since then, it has seen multiple versions, updates and has grown to the next level. In this blog on what is JavaScript, we will learn the basic concepts of JavaScript.</p>\r\n        &nbsp;<p className='text-2xl'><strong>What is JavaScript ?</strong></p>&nbsp;\r\n        <blockquote>\r\n          <p>JavaScript is a high level, interpreted, programming language used to make web pages more interactive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n        </blockquote>\r\n        <p>&nbsp;Have you ever thought that your website is missing something?&nbsp;Maybe it&rsquo;s not engaging enough or it&rsquo;s not as creative as you want it to be.&nbsp;JavaScript is that missing piece which can be used to enhance web pages, applications, etc to provide a more user-friendly experience.</p>\r\n        <p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bl.png\" alt=\"what is JAvascript\" width=\"1000\" height=\"300\" data-cke-saved-src=\"https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bl.png\" /></p>\r\n        &nbsp;<p>JavaScript is the language of the web, it is used to make the web look alive by adding motion to it. To be more precise, it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;programming&nbsp;language that let&rsquo;s you implement complex and beautiful things/design on web pages. When you notice a web page doing more than just sit there and gawk at you, you can bet that the web page is using JavaScript.&nbsp;</p>\r\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n        <p className='text-2xl'><strong>Feature of JavaScript</strong></p>\r\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li className='text-xl'><strong>Scripting language and not Java :</strong>&nbsp;In fact, JavaScript has nothing to do with Java. Then why is it called &ldquo;Java&rdquo; Script? When JavaScript was first released it was called Mocha, it was later renamed to LiveScript and then to JavaScript when Netscape (founded JavaScript) and Sun did a license agreement.&nbsp;</li>\r\n          <li className='text-xl'><strong>Object-based scripting language</strong>&nbsp;which supports polymorphism, encapsulation and to some extent inheritance as well.</li>\r\n          <li className='text-xl'><strong>Interpreted language:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be compiled like Java and C which require a compiler.</li>\r\n          <li className='text-xl'><strong>JavaScript runs in a browser:</strong>&nbsp;You can run it on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc. JavaScript can execute not only in the browser but also on the server and any device which has a JavaScript Engine.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n      </div>","author":"Pankaj","description":"Welcome to the blog of Pankaj where you can get the update of all Kind the technologie which help to update with latest technology Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
